Design a Geometry class with the following methods:
    A static method that accepts the radius of a circle and returns the area of the circle. Use the following formula:
        Area = π * r * 2
        Use Math.PI for π and r for the radius of the circle
    A static method that accepts the length and width of a rectangle and returns the area of the rectangle.
     Use the following formula:
        Area = Length x Width
    A static method that accepts the length of a triangle’s base and the triangle’s height.
     The method should return the area of the triangle. Use the following formula:
        Area = Base x Height x 0.5

The methods should display an error message if negative values are used for the circle’s radius,
... the rectangle’s length or width, or the triangle’s base or height.

Next write a program to test the class, which displays the following menu and responds to the user’s selection:*/
